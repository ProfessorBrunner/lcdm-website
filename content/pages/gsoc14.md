Summary: Information for Prospective Google Summer of CODE 2014 Students

## Prospective GSoC Students

We are looking for motivated students to pursue interesting projects at
the intersection of statistics, computer science and astrophysics. If
this sounds like you, we would love to have you apply to participate in
the LCDM Google Summer of Code!

If you are interested, please contact Professor Brunner. To see the
updated list of projects, visit the LCDM [experimental
projects](xprojects.html) section of the website.

The application deadline for the GSoC 2014 program is Friday, March 21,
2014. You are encouraged to submit your application early in order to
allow us to provide critical feedback to improve your chances of being
selected. A successful proposal to work with the LCDM must follow the
[LCDM GSoC Template](gsoctemplate.html) in order to be sure all required information is
included in your proposal.

A [good
guideline](https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/Expectations) for
what we expect from a GSoC Student has been compiled by the
[Python](www.python.org) software foundation.

## Project List

The primary source for project ideas is the LCDM [experimental
projects](xprojects.html), which are open to all students. This list of
projects should be considered a starting point for GSoC applicants. For
example, some of these projects are aimed at new graduate students, thus
you might rescope a project to more clearly fit in a three-month coding
window. While we encourage you to be ambitious, we also expect you to be
realistic.

You also can propose your own idea, as long as it fits the general
research interests of the LCDM, which admittedly are quite broad.
General consideration to projects involving astrophysical investigations
that make use of machine learning, computer vision, cloud computing, or
statistics are of interest. Especially when applied to extremely large
image repositories (Petabyte or beyond) that also might involve synoptic
(or time domain) components.

## Mentors

The primary mentor and point of contact for all projects is Professor
Brunner. In addition, the following scientists have agreed to serve as
mentors for specific projects.

- Feng Liang, University of Illinois, Professor, Statistics
- Xianmin Lin, University of Illinois, Graduate Student, ECE
- Edward Kim, University of Illinois, Graduate Student, Physics
- Matias Carrrasco-Kind, University of Illinois, Graduate Student, Astronomy
