Summary: Develop Python based implementation of popular machine learning classifications

## Project Synopsis

Develop Python based versions of several popular classification
algorithms including SVM and random forests that can scale to billions
of source.

## Project Description

With the growth of large surveys in astronomy, we need rapid
implementations to reliably classify sources detected in PB-scale
imaging surveys as star, galaxy, artifact, or unknown. This project will
require a student to develop machine learning implementations of popular
algorithms in the Python and Java programming languages for the source
classification problem. Particular algorithms of interest include a
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Random Forest.

## Programming Notes

TBD

## Starting Conditions

Existing work on both of these approaches (and
several others) already exists. But the implementations are written in
other languages. The student will take these existing implementations
and existing machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or Mahout and
leverage existing codes to make more precise classifications.

## Expected Outcome

The student will develop classification
implementations in Python by using scikit-learn and in Java by using
Apache Mahout for the SVM and Random Forest algorithms. A secondary goal
will be to compare the performance and efficacy of these different language
implementations on real survey data.

## Personnel

The lead mentor for this project is Edward Kim, with assistance from Professor Brunner.
