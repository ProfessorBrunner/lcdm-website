Summary: We want to develop a new mobile application to broaden crowdsourcing classification projects.

## Project Synopsis

Traditional crowdsourcing, like the
[ZooUniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org) project, are web-based and
best completed at a traditional computer. With the growth in mobile
computing, however, the time has come to move crowdsourcing
classification technology to the mobile world.

## Project Description

At the start, this application will simply support the _single image
single classification model_ currently employed by many crowdsourcing
experiments. If possible, the design should remain flexible enough to
support our _zero to many_ classifications approach.

Ideally this will be a standalone mobile application, however, the
approach is flexible such that if a sufficient design can be
demonstrated that accomplishes the project's goals by using mobile web
technologies.

## Programming Notes

One can image that a mobile application could make use of simple
gestures to speed up the analysis. For example swipe left for star,
swipe right for galaxy. More complex ontologies would require additional
interface constructs.

- The initial target platform will be the iOS platform

- Time permitting, the Android platform will also be targeted.

- An optional security check should be implemented to support
crowdsourcing on non-public data.

- The database backend will be SQL-92 complaint. The student will not be
required to implement this, but may work on this also if it simplifies
the development of the overall application.

- The image server will respond to URL requests. The student can safely
assume this exists, although this also can be developed as part of a
project if doing so simplifies the development  of he application.

## Starting Conditions

This project is currently in the design stage.

## Expected Outcome

Ideally a new mobile application will be completed for the iOS platform
and for the Android platform.

## Personnel

The lead mentor for this project is Xianming Liu, with assistance from Professor Brunner.
