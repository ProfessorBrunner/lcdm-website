Summary: Develop a Bayesian source detection and characterization application.

## Project Synopsis

Find and characterize sources in astronomical images by applying Bayesian Modeling.

## Project Description

Challenge will be to find peaks and to model them with an appropriate
set of basis functions. A mixture of Gaussians is one possibility.

## Programming Notes

- Develop in Python

- Apply to simulated images in one band

- Extend modeling to multiple bands

- Scale to PB data regime

## Starting Conditions

This project is currently in the design stage.

## Expected Outcome

TBD.

## Personnel

The lead mentor for this project is Professor Brunner.
