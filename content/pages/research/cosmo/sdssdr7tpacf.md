Summary: We calculate the galaxy two-point angular correlation function for the SDSS DR7


### Implementation

The correlation function measurements made use of our fast two point
correlation function [code](/code/tpacf.html), which we have publicly released.

### Data

We have released the [data](/data/sdssDR7-tpacf.html) used in the
measurements of the SDSS DR7 Two-Point Correlation Functions.
