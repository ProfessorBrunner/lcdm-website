Summary: Estimating redshifts by using broadband photometry.

Spectroscopic observations provide a most robust measurement of a
cosmological distance to extragalactic sources; however, since they are
considerably more expensive to obtain than photometric observations,
spectroscopic analyses are often limited by sample size, survey
complexity (i.e., masks), and survey depth. Photometric samples are
currently at least 100 times larger numerically than spectroscopic
samples, have relatively simple and uniform selection functions, and
extend to fainter flux limits (and thus much larger cosmic volumes).
These trends will only become more significant; NSF funded projects such
as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST), which was recently prioritized as the highest ground based
Astronomy project (National Research Council 2010), will increase the
photometric samples by several orders of magnitude. 

As a result, we have embarked on a program to optimally estimate
redshifts by using *only* broadband photometric observations.
