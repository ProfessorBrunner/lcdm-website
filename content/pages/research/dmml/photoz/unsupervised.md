Summary:  We develop and apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to the problem of estimating photometric redshifts.

## Unsupervised photometric redshift estimation

We have developed a new technique that uses self-organizing maps and a
new random atlas  to estimate photometric redshift probability density
functions (PDFs).
