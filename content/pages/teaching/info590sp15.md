## INFO 590: High Performance Visualization for Large-Scale Scientific Data Analytics

### Spring 2015 Semester

### Course Overview

Welcome to INFO 590, a course, led by Professor Han-Wei Shen from Ohio
State University, with Professor Robert Brunner at the University of
Illinois serving as the local instructor. This course guides students in
the art of using visualizations to analyze scientific data sets. This
course will also be of interest to students who are interested in the
art of visualizations themselves, for example as a research topic for
more advanced studies.

We will be using the Illinois [moodle
site](https://learn.illinois.edu/course/view.php?id=9719) as the
official course home.
