## ASTR 330: Search for Extraterrestrial Life

### Spring 2015 Semester

### Course Overview

Welcome to ASTR 330, a course that covers a very dynamic subject. As a
result, the material will be changing, not just from one year to
another, but from the creation of the lecture notes to their delivery!
Over the last decade or so, we have gone from nine planets around one
start, to hundreds of confirmed planets around many different stars. Recent
results indicate that--on average--every normal star in our galaxy has at
least one planet, and that Earth sized planets are likely to be more
numerous than Jupiter sized planets. In the near future, space missions
(from, e.g., NASA) will search for life in our solar system. This truly
is an exciting time to be taking (and teaching) this course!

###Course Introduction

In this course, we will address one of the greatest scientific questions
of all time: **_Are we alone_?** This question reaches beyond simple
scientific curiosity and touches nearly every phase of our civilization.
We will approach this question from a purely scientific basis. Thus my
goal for a graduate of this course is that they will understand our
current scientific view of life in the universe, conceptualize the
factors involved with the ultimate question, propose what the future may
hold for the field, make informed decisions about science policies, and
hold any discovery of extraterrestrial life to a high, personal
scientific standard of proof.
Nonetheless, this class is designed to be
fun. It will endeavor to teach the student about the possibilities of
extraterrestrial life, but I will also combine various topics. This
course will revolve around an equation called the Drake Equation. The
Drake Equation looks like an attempt to estimate how many intelligent
extraterrestrial civilizations exist with whom we might be able to
communicate in our Galaxy. However, the equation actually helps us
understand our ignorance about the subject and illuminates the various
topics and issues worth thinking about when we ask the question Is there
life out there?, with an open mind. We may never know the answer in our
lifetimes, but it is a serious scientific question.

After some introductory material to get us thinking about what we mean
by life, we review some basic astronomy. After that, we cover topics in:
planetary and solar system astronomy; biology and biochemistry; geology,
paleontology, and evolution; some more detailed planetary astronomy;
history and the future of mankind on Earth; and finally, interstellar
communication and travel, including UFO's. In addition, the class
presentations will allow us to adventure wherever the interests of the
class take us. Take part in the journey!
