Summary: We have released Version 1.0 of our PDF Storage for Photometric Redshifts software package.

## Introduction

We have implemented a software package that produces a compressed
representation of a photometric redshift probabilistic density function
(PDF). This code implements the techniques presented in our [Sparse
Representation of Photometric Redshift
PDFs]({filename}/pages/papers/pdfZstorage.md) paper.

## Public Archive

The code base will eventually be migrated to [github](https://github.com/ProfessorBrunner).

## Original Archive

The currently published [PDF Storage](/static/code/) implementation is permanently
archived at the LCDM site.
