Summary: We have released Version 1.0 of our PDF Storage for Photometric Redshifts software package.

## Introduction

We have implemented a software package that produces a compressed
representation of a photometric redshift probabilistic density function
(PDF). This code implements the techniques presented in our [Sparse
Representation of Photometric Redshift
PDFs]({filename}/pages/papers/pdfZstorage.md) paper. This package will be soon incorporated as part as the [MLZ](http://lcdm.astro.illinois.edu/code/mlz.html) package.

## Public Archive

The code base is currently in [github](https://github.com/mgckind/SparsePz) but soon it will incorporated as part as the [MLZ](http://lcdm.astro.illinois.edu/code/mlz.html) repository

## Original Archive

The currently published PDF Storage implementation [SparePz](/static/code/pdfz/SparsePz.zip)  is permanently archived at the LCDM site.
