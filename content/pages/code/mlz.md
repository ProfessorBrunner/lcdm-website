Summary: We have released Version 1.0 of our Machine Learning for Photometric Redshifts software package.

## Introduction

We have implemented a machine learning software package that combines
all of our recent photometric redshift algorithms and implementations.
Specific details about the supervised algorithm is available in our
[Random Forest Photo-z]({filename}/pages/papers/TPZ.md) paper. Likewise,
details about the unsupervised algorithm is available in our [Random
Atlas Photo-z]({filename}/pages/papers/SOMZ.md) paper. 

## Public Archive

The code base will eventually be migrated to [github](https://github.com/ProfessorBrunner).

## Original Archive

The currently published [MLZ](/static/code/mlz/MLZ-1.0.tar.gz) implementation is permanently
archived at the LCDM site, as is the [MLZ documentation](/static/code/mlz/MLZ-1.0/doc/html/index.html).
