## Undergraduate Research Projects

The following list of projects are currently open for undergraduate
researchers, including Google Sumer of Code particpants. If you have an
interest in a related concept, feel free to propose something new,
especially if it lies in the fields of computer vision, machine
learning, or cloud computing (or all three!). If you are interested in
any of these projects, please contact Professor Brunner directly.
