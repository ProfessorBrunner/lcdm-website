## GSoC Application Information

Please be sure to read the main [LCDM GSoC information](ugprojects.html) page as well as
the associated project page before you submit your application.

Students should have contacted Professor Brunner prior to a submission.
We encourage all applicants to have worked with Professor Brunner and
possibly other mentors to improve their proposal prior to submission.

In addition to this proposal template, please complete and submit your
solution to the [LCDM GSoC programming](gsoccode.html)
assignment (or a suitable code sample you have developed for your
project of interest) directly to Professor Brunner prior to the closing
of the GSoC student application (i.e., prior to March 20, 2014).

## GSoC Student Proposal Template

A successful application will contain the following information, along
with meeting all Google Summer of Code 2014 requirements. Note you will
submit this directly to Google via the [GSoC main
page](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014). You
can not register until Monday, March 10, 2014. Do not try to join the
LCDM organization.

### Personal Information

This section introduces you to us. The GSoC activity will be very
demanding and we will need to work together to reach a successful
outcome. Getting to know each other will help us reach our common goals.

- **Full Name**:

- **Contact Information**: include, at a minimum, the following information.
- - Email
- - Instant Messaging Contact (e.g., Skype)
- - Home Address
- - Web Page URL
- - Phone Number

- **Work Location**: (including timezone)

- **University and Department**:

- **Short Biography**: include details on your work interests, fields of
study, free time activities, etc. Use this section to help us get to
know you better, which can be very helpful in making your application
stand out from the others we may receive. When will you work on this
project (local times)? Also include in this section your other expected
time commitments for the summer and how you will guarantee you can
complete this project on time.

### Technical Background

This section will present your qualifications for working on your
proposed project. Remember, others are likely proposing for the same
project, so why should we choose you over them. Everyone will be telling
us they will __work hard__, so what makes you the best? Why can you
complete this project? What skills do you have that are relevant (be
sure to provide mechanisms for us to evaluate these skills)?

- **Summary of technical skills**: Include programming languages, relevant
educational or work experiences, experience with source code
repositories, etc. 

- **Computational experience**: What operating system do you use on your
computer? What operating systems have you used? Have you ever worked
with virtualization like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)? Have
you ever used a supercomputer or cloud computing system?

- **Relevant Knowledge**: Can you demonstrate that you understand the
relevant scientific concepts? Do you have sufficient mathematical,
statistical, computer science, and astrophysics knowledge to complete
the proposed project? Note, we don't expect you to be an expert in
everything (no one is), but we do expect you to understand the basics
and know enough to know when you need to ask for help.

### Project Details

This section is where you present your proposed research project and
demonstrate a plan for completing this project on time.

- **Title**:

- **Abstract**: Succinct summary of the project and overal goals.

- **Objective**: Describe the overall project, the fundamental challenge,
and your proposed solution.

- **Deliverables**: What will be delivered? Describe source code products,
documentation, example tests, regression tests. Enumerate all
deliverables and describe fully, this will ensure project payments are
made on time.

- **Timeline**: When will deliverables be completed? There should be interm
release points, which will help in midterm evaluations. Be conscious of
time costs, and clearly indicate your goals. This will simplify the task
of the mentor in ensuring you are making progress.
