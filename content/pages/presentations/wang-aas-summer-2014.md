Summary: We analyze the clustering of photometrically selected galaxy pairs by using the halo-occupation distribution (HOD) statistics. We measure the two-point correlation functions for galaxies and galaxy pairs and find (HOD) statistics. We measure the two-point correlation functions for galaxies and galaxy pairs and find their HODs to model the clustering. Our results are successfully fit by the HOD models and we can see the their HODs to model the clustering. Our results are successfully fit by the HOD models and we can see the separation of '1-halo' and '2-halo' clustering terms for both single galaxies and galaxy pairs. We find that separation of '1-halo' and '2-halo' clustering terms for both single galaxies and galaxy pairs. We find that the galaxy pairs generally have larger clustering amplitudes than single galaxies, and the quantities after the galaxy pairs generally have larger clustering amplitudes than single galaxies, and the quantities after the HOD fitting, i.e. effective mass and linear bias, are also larger in pairs. We find the central fractions for the HOD fitting, i.e. effective mass and linear bias, are also larger in pairs. We find the central fractions for galaxy pairs are significantly higher than that of the single galaxies, which confirms that the galaxy pairs galaxy pairs are significantly higher than that of the single galaxies, which confirms that the galaxy pairs are formed at the center of more massive haloes. are formed at the center of more massive haloes.
