Summary: With the growth in current and future large photometric surveys, the quantification and mitigation of systematic effects that might bias the structure of universe has become more acute than ever. Therefore, we present specific diagnostic tests that we developed and tested on the SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7) (Abazajian et al. 2009) and created a clean galaxy catalog. We also present our analysis of galaxy clustering and halo modeling based on this catalog.
