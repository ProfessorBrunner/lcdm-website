Summary: Yiran Wang successfully defends her Ph.D. thesis.

Yiran successfully defended her Ph.D. thesis today in the Department of
Astronomy at the University of Illinois. Her thesis, entitled __Modeling
Large Scale Structure from Photometric Galaxy Surveys__ detailed the
full steps for successfully measuring and understanding large scale
structure from photometric surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
the Dark Energy Survey, and the forthcoming Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope. This included detailing new ways to quantify and mitigate
systematic effects, new measurements of the angular two-point
correlation function by using data from the SDSS, and the creation of a
compact galaxy group catalog, from which new correlation functions were
made. Finally, she developed a new halo occupation distribution model to
quantify how compact galaxy groups are distributed in dark matter halos.

Her full Ph.D thesis is available as a PDF file.

Congratulations Yiran!
