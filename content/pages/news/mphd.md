Summary: Matias Carrasco-Kind successfully defends his Ph.D. thesis.

Matias successfully defended his Ph.D. thesis today in the Department of
Astronomy at the University of Illinois. His thesis, entitled
__Probabilistic Photometric Redshifts in the Era of Petascale
Astronomy__ detailed three new ways to estimate probabilistic distances
to extragalactic sources. In addition, new techniques for combining
multiple probabilistic distance estimates were presented  along with
techniques for identifying catastrophic outliers. Finally, a discussion
of how these new probabilistic distance estimates could impact
cosmological measurements was presented.

His full Ph.D thesis is available as a PDF file.

Congratulations Matias!
