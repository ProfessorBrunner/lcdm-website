Summary: The LCDM has an updated website.

The LCDM has a new website, which is powered by [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/) that is a static site content generator written in [Python](http://www.python.org). A static site has several benefits, including fewer security breaches and a reduced server load. All content should be available under the new site. Comments are appreicated.
